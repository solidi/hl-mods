## v1 Recommendations

## GSS January 2026

General Issues
[ ] ability for player to choose auto assign / red or blue team, where appropriate?
[ ] roll through all gameplay and ask AI what mutator and runes to filter?
[x] All bots but needed one more vote for mutators?
    Example: Napoleon crashed but wasnt on the board. Confirm that only people connected are counted.
[x] No file located on server connect - sound/ambience/thunder_clap.wav
[x] waterflow2.wav is missing
[ ] MWHEELDOWN in config doesnt have Mouse Wheel Up associated text
[x] If timer is running out, countdown last five seconds?
[x] RTV vote time should be increased from 30 to 60 or turned to cvar
[x] Gate a lot of thinks not to fire at of game
[x] balance out random mutators in chaos, so that all get a chance before reset
[x] Add timestamp to client talking
Maps
[x] Add more spawn points in glup
[ ] cold_base.bsp outside area showing tunnel in sky
[x] snowyard spawn point on healthkit in yard, people get stuck
[ ] focus - outside area near window (snow incline), stuck
[ ] bounce2 - inside tunnel, spawn facing wall?
[ ] frosty - stuck in wall, second level
[x] From Ben_Montes' video, add the size of the map to voting
Busters
[x] Large shell on taunt hands if having cloak rune and buster
[x] Note to player in busters as skeleton to find the buster - not the skeleton
[x] The buster is dead, but cannot find egon - move it around every thirty seconds or give to someone?
[x] Remove average ping on scoreboard
Cold Skulls
[x] ask AI how to make it better so more skulls can be collected
Cold spot
[ ] Cold Spot should be renamed to "King of the Cold Spot" in description 
[x] The coldspot should stop giving point after game 
[x] Print in center that you scored a point, add prize sound
[x] Hud indicator that floats at the borders so it directs the player to cold spot?
Gungame
[x] Print Leveled Up! in center, add prize sound
Prophunt
[x] No fall damage to convert
[x] bot doesnt pause if prop after hunters released
[x] Still needs further testing related to gameplay to smooth it out
Shidden
[ ] Add "your shiting yourself" voice over
[ ] Change to Frozen, fart freezes, then must knife attack.
[ ] less players as delaters.
[x] Cannot understand what team im on
[x] Hiders dont die in the pit on glup - trigger hurt should hurt them?
JVS
[x] balance out participants to JVS, so all get a chance.
Snowballs
[ ] Add infinity snowbals, and remove the fists
[ ] Add powerup like a snowball gun that is also a slime thrower - modeled after hlwe15, and a rune that gives you it (similar to instagib)
[x] Better control of snowball throw - [seen in snowwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0nMLacofDs)
Instagib
[x] Remove runes like half damage
[x] Spread number is off by one
Horde mode
[x] Monster should look down and attack person below - Ask AI
[x] no one won when round ended, but all monsters defeated (2 players left)
New Stuff
[ ] Train AI to make new map?
[ ] Add support paper to v_ models
[ ] Tinnitus mutator
[ ] Ice tean ps3 brown filter mutator - name it iced tea
[ ] oj mutator, like ice tea but orange
[ ] skycrane - touch the sky and you die 
[ ] Ice cold mutator, flip it all
[ ] skybox mutator kill mutator
[ ] ricochet mutator speed should match weapon fire rate
[ ] From Ben_Montes’ video, add an armor bar and/or damage numbers?
[ ] upside down mutator (180)
[ ] mclaine mutator (gun upside down)
[ ] am I dead mutator (80)
[ ] no radar mutator
[ ] perm arrow on player head w/ life bar see through walls
[x] distance read out for edge detection under arrow
