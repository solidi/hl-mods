# Cold Ice Remastered Roadmap

## Mission

To faithfully recreate the Cold Ice 1.75 experience that works in Half-Life GoldSrc.

## First Principles

1. To reuse models, maps, and sound effects as they were back in the original version
1. More is more with weapons - if the game can handle it, add more of it
1. To listen to the community on playability and update direction on suggestive feedback

1. Game Modes
    1. [ ] Ice Tag - Teamplay, two teams. -When a player is killed (not a suiside) that player is Frozen. A frozen player will die after say 10-15 seconds, however if a teammate touches them they will revive (unfreeze).If all players on a give team are frozen then the round is lost by that team. (Napoleon's idea)
    1. [ ] Assimilated - if you frag a player from the opponent's team they join your team - the players can't change teams, and the round ends when the time runs out or when all players are in one team at any given point - basically kill and assimilate - obviously... I need to figure out what happens when the player count drops under two... xD - I would assume the round ends and those two players would be sucked back into waiting as observer lol. Or game could go so that if the last person is fragged on the opposite team, and then it ends. "Assimilated" is a nice name to the mode... (Napoleon's idea)
    1. [ ] One of those beeing Hide and Seek -> one player gets invisibility that he can use to move around the map, the rest are trying to find and kill him. While moving he's partially visible, while not moving he's invisible. The invisible player gets points every 30 seconds he's not taking damage. The invisible player has no weapons and cannot pick up weapons. If round rules are in effect if the round finishes, the alive invisible player gets a reward.
        [ ] The invisible player only gets slappers / back attack
    1. [ ] Horde mode improvements
        1. [ ] Amount of emenies increase from 5 to 10

        1. [ ] Or, everyone starts as survivors, one person is selected as skeleton in real time
      1. [ ] Skeleton appears the moment fragged from suvivor
    1. [ ] Shidden, Stomp on head
    1. [ ] CtC, more than one chumtoad?
    1. [ ] Chilling - plyers equipped with vice only, kill themself. Typing increases health, using voice as well Frags awarded if reach 200 health.
    1. [ ] Dog tag - on being killed everyone drops a dog tag, that lasts for 10 seconds. On pickup the dogdag gives a buff let's say random one from movement speed, to ammo regen, or health and battery. The goal of the gamemode is to pickup a number of those, let's say 50 and after that the game ends. (Napoleon)
    1. [ ] Frosted gamemode - you fight like normal, but you have a freeze timer. Like 10 seconds on one place you're frozen; additionally 30 seconds with no kill and you die. On kill the timer is reset. (Napoleon)
    1. [ ] [Loot mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXdnKdBK1yg&t=1490s) - start with no weapons, weapons spawn random, one loot item, to be brought back to drop off (snow_camp square)
    1. [ ] Brawler mode - like River City Ransom. Weapons removed. Provide menu for weapons at a cost. Drop money as coins when killed. Use Barf, and other sayings in game as taunts.
    1. [ ] What about "kick the Santa hat"? Where you are just kicking the hat (or frosty head) around the map? Randomly chose two spawn points as goals? (AudioCraZ)
    1. [ ] What about "Hot Potato". Grenade is on a count down to explode,  and you have to throw and hit someone with it. If it lands on the ground, after 2 seconds it goes back to the last player. When it goes off... gib fountain! (AudioCraZ)
    1. [ ] Support

    1. [x] Capture the Chumtoad (Audiocraz)
        1. The object of 'Catch the Chumtoad' is to hold onto the toad as long as you can without being fragged by your friends. You receive 1 point for every 10 seconds you hold onto the toad (the time of course is variable). Players without the toad can only hurt the toad holder, not each other or themselves, so you can use big weapons as recklessly as you like.
        1. When someone picked up the Chumtoad, it made several loud clucks, and a text announcement was made "player picked up the Chumtoad".
        1. When you ran around, there were feathers would fall to the ground in a path and not fade away for 10-15 seconds.
        1. If you stood still, the Chumtoad would make a long drawn out "bawk" every few seconds.
        1. You could "throw" the Chumtoad either at the ground, or at another player. If caught by the player, they would immediately catch it (this lead to tactics as throwing a Chumtoad at a player, killing them, and taking the Chumtoad back)
        1. I can't remember if there were weapons allowed or mele only. I believe there were modifiers.
        1. Chumtoad holder had extra health
        1. Chumtoad holder had faster run speed (I believe this was with guns enabled).
