Cold Ice Remastered Edition

This project is a modern open-sourced rebuild of Cold Ice 1.75, a popular Half-Life mod back in 1999. Set in a winter scene, its philosophy is to deliver deathmatch that doesn't take itself seriously. Only in this mod will you find voiceover cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Hans Gruber, and "Leeroy Jenkins" by Ben Schulz. Its ethos delivers an explosively frantic fast-paced gameplay that was and always will be Cold Ice.

Highly-Valued Upcoming Features:

- See more on our living roadmap: https://github.com/solidi/hl-mods/blob/master/workspace/plan/roadmap.md

Installation:

- For Steam: Place ice_betax, ice_betax_hd, and ice_betax_sp, folders in the same folder where hl.exe is installed.
    - See this guide for a step-by-step guide on how to install this mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174908119
- For Xash3d: Since Xash3d does not support SD/HD model switching, install the ice_betax folder first where xash3d.exe is located. Then copy ice_betax_hd contents, and paste them over the ice_betax folder, overwriting the SD models.

How to Play:

Start or join a Cold Ice server. You will spawn with fists and a randomly selected melee weapon. Don't forget you have an off-handed grapple hook and iron sights! (See below). Server and client options below will dictate gameplay. Then, have fun.

If you dislike the "blue" theme, this mod has the option to switch to real skins! (See below)
